\title{hdflex: High-Dimensional Density Forecasts}
\description{
hdflex contains the forecasting algorithm STSC
developed by Adämmer, Lehmann and Schüssler (2023) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4342487>.
STSC is a novel time series forecasting method designed to handle very large
sets of predictive signals, many of which are irrelevant or have only
short-lived predictive power.
Please cite the paper when using the package.
