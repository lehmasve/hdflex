Description: Provides a forecasting method that efficiently maps vast
    numbers of (scalar-valued) signals into an aggregate density forecast
    in a time-varying and computationally fast manner. The method proceeds
    in two steps: First, it transforms a predictive signal into a density
    forecast and, second, it combines the resulting candidate density
    forecasts into an ultimate aggregate density forecast.  For a detailed
    explanation of the method, please refer to Adaemmer et al. (2023)
